			<p>Hi, welcome to Half-Quality Memes! This is a place for me to post random meme-ish art, whether it be drawings, 3D renders, or animations. </p>
			<p>Come back every Wednesday/Thursday (depending on timezones), for a fresh new meme!</p>
			<p>If you'd like to share these around the internet, be my guest! However, please do include credit if you repost any work of mine (a link back to this page would be most appreciated), and don't take credit for my work. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>If you enjoyed any work of these, or just want to chat, please shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:halfofbilly@halfofbilly.com">halfofbilly@halfofbilly.com</a>. Reading messages from fellow internet users makes my day! :)</p>

		<p><b>2024-05-09: BIG SLICE</b></p>
		<img style="position:relative;width:50%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="24-05-09 -- BIG SLICE HD.png" alt="Peppino slapping The Noise from Pizza Tower across the face. Noise is saying 'Woag' and Peppino is saying 'Yeeeoooooowww'" class="linkicons">
		<p> Idk, I thought the situation in which these two somehow exist in the same universe would be funny, and decided to draw it :)</p>
		<p> Peppino holding the phone is inspired by an ultimately unused sprite that was to act as the 'begin game' button in Pizza Tower's title screen.<br>
		<a href="24-05-09 -- BIG SLICE Timelapse.mp4" target="_blank">Here is a timelapse of me creating this drawing. </a></p>

		<p><b>2024-05-02: Peppino Slap Noise</b></p>
		<img style="position:relative;width:50%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="24-05-02 -- Woag! HD.png" alt="Peppino slapping The Noise from Pizza Tower across the face. Noise is saying 'Woag' and Peppino is saying 'Yeeeoooooowww'" class="linkicons">
		<p> Inspired by <a href="References/BatmanSlapRobin.jpeg" target="_blank">this meme of Batman slapping Robin</a>.</p>
		<p> Everything in this image was drawn by me, with some light perlin noise to make the image seem as if it were from an old comic strip (similar to the source material). <br>
		If you want to edit your own text into this image, you can download <a href="24-05-02 -- Woag! No text.png" target="_blank">this template version</a> with empty speech bubbles. <br>

		<p><b>2024-04-29: CupTale</b></p>
		<img style="position:relative;width:50%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="24-04-29 -- cuptale HD.png" alt="Cuphead and Tully standing in the judgement hall from Undertale. Tully is saying 'so you finally made it' a 'la Sans from Undertale" class="linkicons">
		<p> I can't hear the word pacifist anymore without thinking about Undertale, please help.</p>
		<p> Aside from the CupHead sprite, which I- admittedly- traced to keep him remebling the in-game version as close as possible, everything in this image was drawn from scratch, or from reference, by yours truly. I applied Perlin Noise, chromatic abberation, and a vignette to make the image look as if it was from in-game. <br>
		The text bubble was spliced together from in-game dialogue.<p>
