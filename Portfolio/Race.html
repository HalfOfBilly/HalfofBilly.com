			<p> This project involved the designing of a billboard for a new Channel 10 show called "Race Around the World". The billboard is to contain various vehicles and names of locations.</p>
			<div>
				<h1 id="Ideas"> GENERATION OF IDEAS </h1>
				<p> Idea generation consisted mostly of thinking up of as many vehicles as I could think of, as well as conceptualising a cental logo. I also prepared the colour Pallete for <a target="_blank" href="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyt3.ggpht.com%2Fa%2FAATXAJwqVp3CxM5aMJL0sUppGRzBF5ZlApnowyT_Ig%3Ds900-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=649a04d73e3264bdec265cee2604b4f21100acf340f460c7dfb48a1c3d78dd60&ipo=images"> Channel 10's logo</a>.</p>
				<p> Most of the vehicles had been designed around the idea of including text on them. However, I only did this with the hot air balloon, as I found it to be the most appropriate for the job (large, blank space).

				<p> To begin, I drew all the vehicles/people to be used on the billboard in a separate document. I began with rough sketches, smoothed the lines, added colour, and finally shaded and added extra detail.</p>
				<p> Later on, I changed the hot air ballon's colour to resemble Channel 10's logo; I had previously coloured it to reflect the show's logo. </p>

				<p> Aside from assembling the previously created assets, the final billboard involved creating a central logo and title. I chose for the logo to resemble the figures running around the world I had conceptualised in the drafts. </p>
				<p> Finally, I added a background in the form of a world map, marking out significant locations.</p>
