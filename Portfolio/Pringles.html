			<p> Communication Need 1 involved redesigning the Pringles Logo and can wrapper with the theme "Road Trip"; a new line of chips for on the road. Additonally, I was to come up with new chip flavours for this promotion </p>
			<div>
				<h1 id="R1"> RESEARCH / GENERATION OF IDEAS </h1>
				<p> To start my research, I looked at  foreign/unusual flavours other chip companies had produced previously. This provided ideas for flavours for me to base my designs off. However, I also planned a design that could be easily used for other flavours, in case the client would want more/different flavours.

				<p> Although many of the draft ideas found their way into the final products, they went through multiple revisions, including some draft renders in Maya to easily adjust angle and lighting before producing a final result </p>

				<h1 id="F1"> DEVELOPMENT OF CONCEPTS </h1>
				<img src="Site-assets//Pringles//Design 1_1.png" alt="Design 1_1" class="banner">
				<p> This design focuses on the idea of incorporating the Pringles logo onto a road sign. I chose the yellow diamond as it's commonly used to warn drivers in Australia about wildlife on roads, and is particularly prevalent in rural/outback areas you may visit on a road trip. It also resembles the original characters head shape rather well.</p>
				<p> (The nutrition information is a stock image taken from the internet. It is not accurate to Pringles and is there only as a placeholder to demonstrate how this design would wrap around a Pringles can.)
				<p></p>

				<img src="Site-assets//Pringles//Design 1_2.png" alt="Design 1_2" class="banner">
				<p> This second design resembles the original packet designs, swaying more to a more simplistic style. I applied the ideas of shaping the word 'Road' to resemble a convertible.</p>
				<p> The classic Pringle chip was redesigned to resemble a hilly road, with a car driving along it. </p>

				<h1 id="F2"> EVALUATION / REFINEMENT </h1>
				<img src="Site-assets//Pringles//Design 2_1.png" alt="Design 2_1" class="banner">
				<p> Nothing in particular was changed for this design, but I did replace the placeholder nutrition information with a Pringles can's nutrition information.</p>
				<p></p>
			</div>
			<img src="Site-assets//Pringles//Design 2_2.png" alt="Design 2_2" class="banner">
			<p> The first draft for this design had not followed the Design Brief's constraits of retaining the figures head shape. This revision adds the original head shape, and modifies the hat to appear less like a top hat, and more like a sun hat.</p>
			<p> Finally, I adjusted the moustache to resemble the original design more, as the first design's seemed off proportionally. </p>

			<p> Communication Need 2 involved producing visualisations of the new campaign advertised on trucks. However, instead of using orthoganol drawings in photoshop (reccomended on the design brief), I opted for 3D rendered images using Maya 2022. </p>

				<h1 id="F3"> DEVELOPMENT OF CONCEPTS </h1> 
				<img src="Site-assets//Pringles//Truck 0.png" alt="Truck 1" class="Truck">
				<p> First draft of the image to be displayed on the trucks. This was mainly used as a reference for image size, and a placeholder. </p>
				<p> For this image, the original can design was expanded. However, I felt this design was a little plain, so I asked some friends on what I could add to improve it.</p>
				<p> One friend suggested adding a promotion to the Road Trip series. So I came up with the idea of adding Australian animals as collectable stickers in each Road Trip Prignles can. This also gave the benefit of adding more life to the scenery with the animals.</p>

				<img src="Site-assets//Pringles//Truck 3.png" alt="Truck 1" class="Truck">
				<p> 
					Transferring the second, simplistic designs onto the trucks was more straightfoward. Aside from cropping, the only things I added to the design was the text 
					<i> "The perfect Roadtrip companion" </i> 
					and a grainy background to represent an outback road.
